__What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?__  
I was not struggling, but because I have not worked with other person on same repository, how to work on a same, single repository was not clear.

__What concepts were clarified during the GPS?__  
How to solve a conflict was new to me. Also, now I’m clear on how to work with others through fetch and merge command. I had a vague idea on difference  between “pull” and “fetch and merge”, but my guide illustrated with a concrete example in what situation fetch and merge prevents troubles from happening.

__What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?__  
I don’t recall many of talk because I was a bit nervous, but since Instructions and concepts were clear, I don’t think I asked a question.

__What still confuses you about Git?__  
I guess since I am too new to Git to even get confused. 

__How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?__  
Having a guide to work through was very helpful and something I want to do periodically, especially on unfamiliar subjects.
